TELNET AND SSH CONFIGURATIONS(REMOTE DEVICE ACCESS)

How to configure Telnet and SSH:
WAYS TO CONFIGURE NETWORKING DEVICES -:
	- Locally using the Line Console (Through Console port and console cables).
	- Remotely using Line VTY (Through Telnet or SSH protocols).

REMOTE ACCESS AND CONFIGURATION:
	- To use Telnet/SSH, you must have a software(Telnet/SSH client) installed eg Putty. 
	- On the Remote Device, a Telnet/SSH server must be installed and running.

TELNET-:
	- TCP port 23
	- All data, including Usernames and Passwords, is sent in cleartext/plaintext-insecure.
	- Rarely used today.

SSH-:
	- TCP port 22
	- Uses encryption and Authentication, hence all data transmitted over the network is secure.
	- Most used today.


CONFIGURING TELNET ON A DEVICE:
	-sw#en
	-sw#conf t
	-sw#line vty 0 15
	-sw#password Cisco@123
	-sw#login
	-sw#do write
	-sw#exit

CONFIGURING SSH:
	a) setup a hostname eg hostname R1
	b) setup a domain name eg ip domain-name GTECH
	c) configure local username and password eg username GTECH password Cisco@123
	d) generate RSA public and private keys. eg crypo key generate rsa
	e) Allow only SSH access:(the following commands disable telnet and enables SSH)
		- R1# line vty 0 15
		- R1# login local
		- R1# transport input ssh
