TRUNK AND ACCESS SWITCHPORT MODES CONFIGURATIONS

- A switch-port can be in one of the two modes:
	a)- Access
	b)- Trunk

- ACCESS LINK: A port that can be assigned to a single VLAN. The frames that arrive on an access port are assumed to be part of the access VLAN.

- TRUNK LINK: A port that is connected to another switch. This port type can carry traffic of multiple VLANs, thus allowing you to extend VLANs across the entire network.
